Fen2Pdf is a small tool for Chess teachers. 

It converts a pgn file with FEN notations (you can create such file easily in lichess or any chess program) to a PDF file with exercises you can print out and hand over to your students.

Enjoy!


ps:  This program is beer licensed, so if you are a happy user,and you run into me, 
don't let anything stop you from showing that gratitude by presenting me a nice cold beer!

pps : I also created PairFx , a free tool for running chess tournaments in the class room or club (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pairfx/)
